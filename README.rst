pymc-submodels
==============

Common submodels used in Bayesian modeling, 
implemented in PyMC.

For example, you may usually use mixture models
but change the likelihood distributions or the base
distributions. Therefore, you can use the
mixture_submodel from mixtures package.

Also, there are available Markov chains inside the 
markov_chain.
